
The first step is to clone the application repository from the Github public code repository. 


>An application repository is a server that stores a developer's code.  It allows multiple developers to work on the same code and controls the versioning of that code.
	
## Task

Clone the source code repository for this application from Github with the following command:

>Select the command below in the code box and it will be automatically executed in the terminal window to the right.

`git clone https://github.com/highvelocityengineering/docker101-python.git docker-python-hello-world`{{execute}}

Notice the editor tile to the top right - a copy of the application repository is now copied to your computer. Within the local repository, you will see a set of files that make up the Python Hello World application.

To view all the files in terminal, run the command: `ls -l docker-python-hello-world/`{{execute}}.

To open a file in editor: `docker-python-hello-world/app.py`{{open}}

>At this point you have the application code on your machine which will allow you to start building the docker container.
