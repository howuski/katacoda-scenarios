
First step is to clone the application repository from Github public code repository. 


>An application repository is a server that stores a developers code.  It allows multiple developers to work on the same code without major confusion.<
	
	

## Task

Clone the source code repository for this application from Github with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/highvelocityengineering/docker101-python.git docker-python-hello-world`{{execute}}

A copy of the sample application repository is now copied in your workspace. Within the repository, you will see a set of files that implements the Python Hello World application in Docker.

To view all the files in terminal, run the command: `ls -l docker-python-hello-world/`{{execute}}. You can also view the files in the editor tile.

To open a file in editor: `docker-python-hello-world/app.py`{{open}}
