
First step is to clone the application repository from Github public code repository. 


>An application repository is a server that stores a developers code.  It allows multiple developers to work on the same code and controls the versioning of that code.
	
## Task

Clone the source code repository for this application from Github with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/highvelocityengineering/docker101-python.git docker-python-hello-world`{{execute}}

Notice the window to the right - a copy of the sample application repository is now copied to your computer. Within the local repository, you will see a set of files that compose the Python Hello World application in Docker.

To view all the files in terminal, run the command: `ls -l docker-python-hello-world/`{{execute}}. You can also view the files in the editor tile.

To open a file in editor: `docker-python-hello-world/app.py`{{open}}

>At this point you have the application code on your machine which will allow you to start building the docker container.
