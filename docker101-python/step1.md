## Overview

Before we get started let's take a quick look at what all these windows are supposed to show us:

The window on the left side of your browser is your tutorial window.  It's where you'll read the demo information and enter commands.

The small window in the middle is the file directory window.  This is where you can view your file directory.   

The large window to the right is the directory view.  Click on something in the file directory window and the contents will show in the directory view. 

Below the directory window and view is the Terminal where your commands will run.  This is where you can see the action.
