```Docker images are immutable so if we make any new changes we create a new docker image.```


As you click on the docker build command notice we're going to tag the docker image with a new tag.
`docker build --tag docker101_springboot_api_v2 .`{{execute T1}}

Now let's look at what docker images we have on our machine

`docker image list`{{execute T1}}

```Since docker images are self-contained and stand-alone you can have multiple versions of the same application and deploy them in minutes.  These differences can not only be your code but dependencies too.```

With the new docker image let's issue the docker run command to get our container up and running.

`docker run --publish 8080:8080 --name katacoda_test_container docker101_springboot_api_v2`{{execute T1}}

Items to note on the docker run command.  We're designating a name on this container so it's easily identifiable.
